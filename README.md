# Package Installer Creator

This service helps to create installers for Unity packages. The API is super simple.

The installers are super hacky (Unity does not provide a clean way to add scoped registries so far), but should work fine from 2019.1 to 2020.2+.

At some point this will hopefully become redundant...
